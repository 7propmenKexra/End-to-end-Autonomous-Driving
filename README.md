## At a Glance

![](figs/overview.jpg)

The autonomous driving community has witnessed a rapid growth in approaches that embrace an end-to-end algorithm framework, utilizing raw sensor input to generate vehicle motion plans, instead of concentrating on individual tasks such as detection and motion prediction.  In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of more than 250 papers on the motivation, roadmap, methodology, challenges, and future trends in end-to-end autonomous driving. More details can be found in the survey paper "[End-to-End Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Frontiers]()".
