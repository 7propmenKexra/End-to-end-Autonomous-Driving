If you are a fan of jazz rock, you probably know Donald Fagen as the co-founder and lead singer of Steely Dan, one of the most influential bands of the 1970s. But did you know that he also released a solo album in 1982 that is considered a masterpiece of pop music?
 
The Nightfly is Fagen's debut solo album, and it showcases his brilliant songwriting, production, and musicianship. The album is a concept album that revolves around the themes of nostalgia, romance, and radio broadcasting in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The songs are filled with witty lyrics, catchy melodies, and sophisticated arrangements that blend jazz, rock, soul, and R&B influences.

The Nightfly was critically acclaimed upon its release, and it was nominated for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. It also reached number 11 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over a million copies in the US. The album is widely regarded as one of the best albums of the 1980s and one of Fagen's finest works.
 
But if you want to experience The Nightfly in its full glory, you should listen to it in remastered FLAC format. FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, and it is a type of digital audio file that preserves the original sound quality of a recording without any compression or loss of data. This means that you can hear every detail and nuance of Fagen's voice, instruments, and production as they were intended by the artist.
 
One of the best remastered versions of The Nightfly is the one released by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) in 2017. MFSL is a company that specializes in audiophile-quality recordings, and they use a process called UltraDisc One-Step (UD1S) to produce vinyl records that have unparalleled sound quality. UD1S involves using only one step of lacquer processing instead of the usual three or four steps, which reduces noise, distortion, and artifacts. The result is a vinyl record that has deep-black backgrounds, boundless soundstaging, pointillist details, staggering dynamics, and lifelike tonalities.
 
But you don't need to own a vinyl record player to enjoy this remastered version of The Nightfly. You can also download it in FLAC format from various online sources[^1^] [^2^], and play it on your computer or mobile device with a compatible audio player. You will need about 1.73 GB of storage space for the high-resolution version (24-bit/192 kHz), or 524 MB for the CD-quality version (16-bit/44.1 kHz). You will also need a good pair of headphones or speakers to appreciate the difference.

But what makes The Nightfly such a great album is not only its sound quality, but also its song quality. The album consists of eight tracks, each one a gem of pop craftsmanship. Fagen draws inspiration from various sources, such as jazz standards, doo-wop classics, and radio broadcasts, and creates his own unique style of storytelling and humor.
 
The opening track, "I.G.Y.", is a catchy and optimistic ode to the International Geophysical Year, a scientific project that took place in 1957-58 and aimed to explore the Earth and space. Fagen imagines a utopian future where technology and progress have solved all the problems of humanity, such as hunger, war, and disease. He sings: "What a beautiful world this will be / What a glorious time to be free".
 
The next track, "Green Flower Street", is a romantic and exotic song about a love affair in a fictional Asian city. Fagen uses colorful imagery and metaphors to describe the setting and the characters, such as "the moon's a silver slipper / it's pouring champagne stars / Broadway's like a serpent / pulling shiny top-down cars". He also references some of his musical influences, such as Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker.
 
"Ruby Baby" is a cover of a 1956 song by The Drifters, written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Fagen gives the song a modern twist, adding synthesizers, saxophones, and backing vocals. He also changes some of the lyrics to make them more personal and humorous, such as "I got a girl and Ruby is her name / She don't love me but I love her just the same / Ruby Baby how I want you / Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt you".
 
"Maxine" is a ballad that tells the story of a young couple who dream of escaping their mundane lives and traveling around the world. Fagen sings with tenderness and nostalgia, accompanied by a piano and a string section. He also references some of his favorite places and movies, such as Paris, Rome, Casablanca, and Breakfast at Tiffany's.
 
"New Frontier" is one of the highlights of the album, a witty and ironic song about a teenage boy who invites his girlfriend to his father's fallout shelter during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Fagen mixes historical facts with pop culture references, such as "We've got provisions and lots of beer / The key word is survival on the new frontier". He also creates a catchy chorus that mimics the sound of a radio jingle: "Introduce me to that big blonde / She's got a touch of Tuesday Weld / She's wearing Ambush and a French twist / She's got us wild and she can tell".
 
"The Nightfly" is the title track and the centerpiece of the album. It is a tribute to the late-night radio DJs that Fagen listened to as a kid, who introduced him to jazz and other genres of music. Fagen plays the role of Lester the Nightfly, a fictional DJ who broadcasts from Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He sings about his love for music, his listeners, and his personal life. He also makes some sarcastic comments about the social and political issues of the time, such as "I've got plenty of java / And Chesterfield Kings / But I feel like crying / I wish I had wings".
 
"The Goodbye Look" is a song about a man who witnesses a coup d'etat in an unnamed Caribbean island. He tries to escape with his lover, but he realizes that she has betrayed him to the rebels. Fagen sings with a sense of resignation and bitterness, over a Latin-inspired groove. He also uses some clever wordplay, such as "I know what happens / I read the book / I believe I just got the goodbye look".
 
The closing track, "Walk Between Raindrops", is a cheerful and upbeat song that celebrates love in spite of adversity. Fagen sings about walking with his lover in New York City during a rainstorm, ignoring the troubles around them. He uses some playful rhymes and metaphors, such as "Some people like us / We get so confused / But don't worry darling / We're not born to lose". He also adds some sound effects of raindrops and thunder at the end of the song.
