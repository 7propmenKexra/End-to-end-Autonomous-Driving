- **Binaural panning plugins:** These plugins use a technique called binaural processing to create 3D sound effects. They mimic the way that our head and ears filter and delay sounds coming from different angles, creating a realistic perception of sound location and movement. They are ideal for creating immersive soundscapes and headphone mixes.
- **Surround panning plugins:** These plugins let you position sounds in a multi-channel surround sound system, such as 5.1 or 7.1. They are useful for creating cinematic and spatial sound effects for film, TV, and video games.

3. **Insert the plugin on a track or a bus:** To apply the plugin to a sound source, you need to insert it on a track or a bus in your DAW. You can use it on individual tracks to pan specific sounds, or on buses to pan groups of sounds or the entire mix.
4. **Adjust the plugin parameters:** To control the panning effect, you need to adjust the plugin parameters according to your desired outcome. Most panning audio VST plugins have similar parameters, such as:
    - **Pan:** This parameter lets you set the horizontal position of the sound source between the left and right speakers.
    - **Width:** This parameter lets you set the stereo width of the sound source, from mono to wide stereo.
    - **Elevation:** This parameter lets you set the vertical position of the sound source between the floor and the ceiling.
    - **Distance:** This parameter lets you set the perceived distance of the sound source from the listener.
    - **Movement:** This parameter lets you set the speed and direction of the sound source movement across the stereo field.
