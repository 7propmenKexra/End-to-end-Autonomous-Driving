# FEFLOW 6.2: A Comprehensive Software for Groundwater and Porous Media Modelling
 
Groundwater is a vital resource for many human activities and ecosystems, but it is also subject to various challenges such as contamination, depletion, subsidence and geothermal exploitation. To address these challenges, groundwater modellers need a powerful and reliable software that can simulate complex processes involving fluid flow, groundwater age, contaminant and heat transport in saturated and unsaturated porous media.
 
FEFLOW 6.2 is a software developed by DHI Group that offers an all-in-one solution for groundwater and porous media modelling. FEFLOW 6.2 enables users to:

- Analyse interactions below the land surface by including underground structures, tunnels and other types of excavation
- Predict potential water quality issues in groundwater and provide remediation strategies
- Model geothermal installations at any scale and depth
- Investigate groundwater-surface water interaction by coupling FEFLOW to other MIKE surface water models
- Estimate ground subsidence and predict pumping rates and stability issues in geotechnical and mining projects

FEFLOW 6.2 is the most intuitive and comprehensive software package used for groundwater and porous media modelling. It has a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily create, edit and visualise 3D models of any complexity and geometry. It also has a rich set of features that cover a wide range of applications, such as:

- Built-in FEFLOW reactive transport engine that can model different contaminant cases from conservative up to complex kinetic reactions
- Advanced heat transport engine that can simulate conduction, convection and radiation processes in geothermal systems
- Unsaturated flow engine that can accurately represent saturation and infiltration processes in open pits or underground mines
- Coupling with other MIKE models such as MIKE SHE, MIKE HYDRO River, MIKE 21 and MIKE 3 for integrated surface water-groundwater modelling
- Coupling with external codes such as PHREEQC, RT3D, UCODE, PEST and FEFLOW Python Interface (FEPI) for enhanced modelling capabilities

FEFLOW 6.2 is supported by a team of experts from DHI Group who provide technical support, training courses, consultancy services and customised solutions. FEFLOW 6.2 is also widely used by researchers, consultants, regulators and students from various fields and industries such as mining, civil engineering, geotechnics, geothermal energy and environmental services.

In this article, we will show you some examples of how FEFLOW 6.2 can be used for different groundwater and porous media modelling applications.
 
## Example 1: Groundwater Contamination and Remediation
 
Groundwater contamination is a serious environmental problem that can pose risks to human health and ecosystems. Contaminants can originate from various sources such as industrial activities, agricultural practices, landfills, septic tanks and accidental spills. Depending on the type and concentration of the contaminants, different remediation strategies may be required to restore the groundwater quality.
 
FEFLOW 6.2 can help groundwater modellers to assess the extent and impact of groundwater contamination and to design and evaluate remediation options. FEFLOW 6.2 has a built-in reactive transport engine that can simulate the transport and transformation of contaminants in groundwater systems. FEFLOW 6.2 can handle both conservative and reactive contaminants, such as metals, organic compounds, nutrients, radionuclides and pathogens. FEFLOW 6.2 can also model complex kinetic reactions, such as biodegradation, sorption, precipitation and dissolution.
 
For example, FEFLOW 6.2 can be used to model the fate and transport of nitrate in a groundwater system affected by agricultural activities. Nitrate is a common groundwater pollutant that can cause eutrophication and health problems. FEFLOW 6.2 can simulate the processes of nitrate leaching from fertilizers, transport in the aquifer, denitrification by bacteria and attenuation by dilution. FEFLOW 6.2 can also evaluate the effectiveness of different remediation measures, such as reducing fertilizer application, installing buffer strips or injecting oxygen or carbon sources to enhance denitrification.
 
## Example 2: Geothermal Energy
 
Geothermal energy is a renewable and clean source of energy that can be used for heating, cooling and electricity generation. Geothermal energy is derived from the heat stored in the Earth's crust and mantle. Geothermal systems can be classified into two types: conventional and enhanced. Conventional geothermal systems exploit natural reservoirs of hot water or steam that are accessible by drilling wells. Enhanced geothermal systems create artificial reservoirs by injecting water into hot dry rocks or fractured formations.
 
FEFLOW 6.2 can help geothermal modellers to design and optimise geothermal installations at any scale and depth. FEFLOW 6.2 has an advanced heat transport engine that can simulate conduction, convection and radiation processes in geothermal systems. FEFLOW 6.2 can also model multiphase flow of water and steam, non-isothermal flow of fluids with variable density and viscosity, heat extraction by production wells and heat injection by reinjection wells.
 
For example, FEFLOW 6.2 can be used to model a deep geothermal system for electricity generation. FEFLOW 6.2 can simulate the flow and heat transfer in the reservoir, the wellbore and the surface equipment. FEFLOW 6.2 can also calculate the thermodynamic properties of water and steam, such as enthalpy, entropy and exergy. FEFLOW 6.2 can also evaluate the performance and efficiency of the geothermal power plant, such as power output, heat rate and net present value.
