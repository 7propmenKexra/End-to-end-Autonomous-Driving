The story is based on a historical incident that took place when Narsi Mehta went to his daughter Nani Bai's in-laws' house to give her dowry (mayra). Narsi Mehta was a poor Brahmin who could not afford to give any lavish gifts to his daughter's in-laws, who belonged to a rich and high-class family. Instead, he brought along a group of 15-16 Vaishnava devotees who sang praises of Lord Krishna. This angered and insulted his daughter's in-laws, who treated him with contempt and mockery. They gave him a long list of expensive items that they expected him to bring as dowry.
 
Narsi Mehta was helpless and prayed to Lord Krishna for help. To his surprise, a wealthy merchant (Sawariya Seth) appeared at the scene and offered to pay for all the items on the list. He also gave Narsi Mehta many more valuable gifts that surpassed the expectations of his daughter's in-laws. The merchant revealed himself to be none other than Lord Krishna himself, who had come to reward Narsi Mehta for his devotion and loyalty. He also told Narsi Mehta's daughter's in-laws that he was Narsi Mehta's servant and did whatever he wished. This stunned and humbled them and they realized their mistake.
 
The story of Nani Bai Ro Mayro Katha is a testament to the power of faith and devotion. It teaches us that God is always with us and takes care of our needs if we surrender to him completely. It also teaches us to be humble and respectful towards others, regardless of their social status or wealth.
  
The story of Nani Bai Ro Mayro Katha is derived from the Bhaktamal, a collection of biographies of saints and devotees of Lord Vishnu. The Bhaktamal was composed by Nabhadas, a 16th-century poet and disciple of Vallabhacharya. The story of Narsi Mehta is also mentioned in other sources, such as the Narsinh Mehta Na Prabhatiya, a collection of morning hymns attributed to Narsi Mehta himself.
 
Narsi Mehta was born in Talaja, Gujarat, in a Nagar Brahmin family. He lost his parents at a young age and was raised by his grandmother. He was married to Manekbai at the age of 13 and had two children, Nani Bai and Shamaldas. He was not interested in worldly affairs and spent most of his time in singing and meditating on Lord Krishna. He composed many poems and songs in praise of Lord Krishna, which are known as bhajans. He is considered to be the first poet of Gujarati literature and the founder of the Vaishnava bhakti movement in Gujarat.
